# Pixelmon Repel Blocks and Spawn Checker
A small sidemod for Pixelmon 1.16.5 that gives you access to a repel block that prevents pokemon from spawning in an area, 
a repel charm that prevents pokemon from spawning near you, and a spawn check item that you can use to see what
pokemon are able to spawn at your location.
